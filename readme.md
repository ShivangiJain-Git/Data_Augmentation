#    Data Augmentation Technique

- ### CONTEXT
  Data augmentation in data analysis are techniques used to increase the amount of data by adding slightly modified copies of already existing data or newly created synthetic
  data from existing data. It acts as a regularizer and helps reduce overfitting when training a machine learning model. It is closely related to oversampling in data analysis. 
  Below are various type of data augmentation techniques:.

- ### TYPES 

	- Image Data Augmentation.
	- Sample Image.
	- Image Augmentation With ImageDataGenerator. 
	- Horizontal and Vertical Shift Augmentation.
	- Horizontal and Vertical Flip Augmentation.
	- Random Rotation Augmentation.
	- Random Brightness Augmentation.
	- Random Zoom Augmentation.
